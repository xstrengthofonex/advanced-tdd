Three Laws of TDD
=================

* RED - Define the problem with a failing test
* GREEN - Solve the problem
* REFACTOR - Clean up


As test gets more specific code gets more generic

Four Phases
-----------

* Arrange - load data structures.
* Act - Perform the action we want to test
* Assertion - Check the output
* Annihilate - Put the system back to its original state
